Part VI: Voter Shit Visualization Design Notes

Visualization I:
This line chart visualization is useful in showing the trends in how one or
more states have shifted politically in time.  It allows you to select
what state(s) to be viewed from either clicking on the state tile or
through brushing the electoral vote chart.  Each state is separated by different
hues, and you can also select whether you want to look at democratic or republican
party percentage.  I personally think this visualization is straight forward
and shows the party % change trends well.

Visualization II:
This multi-bar chart visualization is useful in showing the trends in how one state
has shifted politically in time.  It allows you to select what state to see a trend
by clicking on the state tile.  It allows you to view both the republican and democrat
party% at the same time, and each party year is colored based on a color scale.
(lighter red low R%, darker red high R%, lighter blue D%, darker blue D%).
It is similar to the popular vote% chart but it allows you to view more than
one year at a time which helps in seeing trends.
