Overall I feel that my implementation of the algorithm and it's performance to be
below par.  As soon as I try to run a whole DNA sequence (16000+ characters) my program
takes a very long time to finish.  I left it going for about 3 hours with no luck before
deciding to switch gears and focus on the other study cases.
If I had more time to optimize the code I would be able to
reduce how much memory was being used and also improve run time.

The results I found were very interesting when comparing all the different
DNA sequences in each of the studies:

Study 1 shows that our DNA is very similar (a high score) to that of the
Neanderthal.

Study 2 was fascinating to me, and shows that there are indeed differences
in our DNA between various continents around the world, although they are
very small differences.

Study 3 (with the data I was able to collect) shows that our DNA is closer
to Chimpanzees and Gorillas than the other primates.

A properly optimized version of this algorithm has huge scientific impact.
DNA sequences are massive, and if we want to find similarities between two
different strands, this algorithm is a very clever way to do so.  With
two sequences inputted into this algorithm we can find similarities between
various animals effectively and have actual proof of evolution.
The Needleman-Wunsh Algorithm is one of the first applications of dynamic
programming to compare DNA sequences and to this day is still widely used
for optimal alignment.
