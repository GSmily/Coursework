As I was testing various sizes of O(n^2) I found the following:

n = 4200  -> Run Time = 2.19 Minutes
n = 8340  -> Run Time = 7.77 Minutes
n = 12480 -> Run Time = 17.1 Minutes
n = 16560 -> Run Time = ??? Minutes

We know that this algorithm is very memory heavy and with my current system and/or program
n = 12480 is close to the maximum size for n.
