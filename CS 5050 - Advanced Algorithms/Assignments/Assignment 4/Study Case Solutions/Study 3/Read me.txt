NOTE:
My program runs very slowly on my computer so instead of finding the pairwise of 16000+ characters
in each sequence with eachother, I did 1/4 of each DNA sequence to save time in order to 
compleate all 21 comparisons and to be able to turn this assignment in on time.
I also used PyCharm which made the output look a lot better than the .txt file formating with notepad.

I used 4200 characters in each sequence alignment.
