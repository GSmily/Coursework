NOTE:
My program runs very slowly on my computer so instead of finding the pairwise of 16000+ characters
in each sequence with eachother, I did 1/4 of each DNA sequence to save time in order to 
compleate all 45 comparisons and to be able to turn this assignment in on time.

I used 4200 characters in each sequence alignment.

Below is a detailed list of each DNA sequence and their origins that I used:
 1: Africa - Algeria
 2: America (North) - Mixteca - Baja
 3: America (South) - Guarani
 4: Asia - Aboriginal Malay (Temuan)
 5: Australia - Aborigine
 6: Europe - Abazin
 7: Melanesia - Bougainville
 8: Micronesia - Kapingamarangi Atoll
 9: Middle East - Isreal (Bedouin)
10: Polynesia - Cook Islander
